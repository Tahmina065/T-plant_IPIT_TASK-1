    <h1>These Online Plant Delivery Services Will Totally Greenify Your Home</h1>
    <p>Whether or not you consider yourself a gardener, house plants can brighten up your space as living decor. And many are easy to care for, even if you're a bona fide cactus killer. Besides, the benefits of cultivating an indoor garden are hard to ignore. According to NASA, (yes, that NASA!) house plants can actually scrub the air of pollutants like formaldehyde, benzene and trichloroethylene, as well as recycle carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Plants also release humidity into the air, which can help if the air inside your home gets dried out by your heating and cooling system.

        House plants come with psychological benefits too. A study conducted by Texas A&M found that indoor plants create a calming atmosphere in your home or office. Having a leafy friend nearby actually helps with memory, information retention and even accuracy. They're also a low-risk way to teach kids how to care for a living thing. When you can't make a trip to the nursery, need some help picking the perfect greenery or just want to diversify your shopping habits, try some of these great online plant delivery services. Many of them offer help choosing the perfect species for your space, since you'll want to consider elements like light, temperature and the level of care you're able to dedicate to it. Check with your company of choice before ordering, for updated shipping information, so you know when to watch for your new housemate to arrive.</p>
